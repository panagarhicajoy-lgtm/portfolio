                <p class="highlight">
                    From healthcare to tech, my path has been anything but straight - and I wouldn't have it any other way!
                </p>

                        <h3>Senior High School Graduate</h3>
                        <p>Completed my SHS education at Cagayan Valley Institute (CVI) where I developed strong communication skills and learned the value of active listening - qualities that serve me well in both tech and life.</p>

                        <h3>Nursing Student (Midwifery)</h3>
                        <p>I studied midwifery because I loved helping people. Those two years taught me to stay calm under pressure, notice small details, and care deeply—skills I didn’t realize would also make me a better programmer.

When health challenges changed my path, I found the same problem-solving focus in coding. Now, instead of supporting mothers, I build solutions with code—still using the same care and precision, just in a different way.!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <div class="timeline-year">
                            <i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i> 2022
                        </div>
                        <h3>Midwifery to Tech</h3>
                        <p>When health issues forced me to step away from midwifery, I was heartbroken. But I soon discovered that the skills I loved in healthcare—solving problems, staying calm under pressure, and paying attention to every detail—were just as valuable in tech.

Now, instead of tracking labor progress, I debug code. Instead of handling emergencies in the delivery room, I troubleshoot errors in my programs. The tools changed, but my love for solving problems didn’t.

Sometimes life redirects us—and that’s okay. I’m still helping people, just in a different way.!</p>

                        <h3>First Year BSIT & Secretary</h3>
                        <p>As a fresh BSIT student, I embraced the challenge of learning to code while serving as class secretary. Juggling minutes and methods, I learned organization and teamwork in a tech context.</p>

                        <h3>Third Year Representative</h3>
                        <p>Now representing our department, I bridge communication between students and faculty. My diverse background helps me understand different perspectives and find creative solutions.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Why Tech?</h3>
                <p>My winding path has given me a unique perspective. In healthcare, I learned about systems and precision. In tech, I found a field where I can apply that same care to create solutions that help people in different ways.</p>
